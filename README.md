An (incomplete) Unity project for creating custom valuable mods for REPO.

To use this project, you will need to extract the assets from the game using AssetRipper or something similar, and put them into an `Assets/Assets_Vanilla` folder.
Additionally, if you want to add custom scripts, you will need to add the game's main `Assembly-CSharp.dll` into the `Assets/Plugins` folder so that they can reference vanilla code.


Uses REPOLib to add a number of items as valuables to the game, mostly Star Trek themed. Some have custom sound effects. More valuables likely to be added in the future.
